# A very simple Asteroid-like game made with vanilla JS, and some very minor Tailwind styling via CDN
# This is not 100% original code and was done along side a tutorial to learn some basics on making games via Canvas
# Expanded features that ARE original code are coming (i.e. movement, hold-to-shoot, etc.)
